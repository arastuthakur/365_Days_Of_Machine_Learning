## Introduction to Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection (aka outlier analysis) is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a dataset’s normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for instance, a change in consumer behavior. Machine learning is progressively being used to automate anomaly detection.

## Understanding Anomalies
With all the analytics programs and various management software available, it’s now easier than ever for companies to effectively measure every single aspect of business activity. This includes the operational performance of applications and infrastructure components as well as key performance indicators (KPIs) that evaluate the success of the organization. With millions of metrics that can be measured, companies tend to end up with quite an impressive dataset to explore the performance of their business.

Within this dataset are data patterns that represent business as usual. An unexpected change within these data patterns, or an event that does not conform to the expected data pattern, is considered an anomaly. In other words, an anomaly is a deviation from business as usual.

But then what do we mean by “business as usual” when it comes to business metrics?  Surely we don’t mean “unchanging” or “constant;” there’s nothing unusual about an eCommerce website collecting a large amount of revenue in a single day – certainly if that day is Cyber Monday. That’s not unusual because a high volume of sales on Cyber Monday is a well-established peak in the natural business cycle of any business with a web storefront.

Indeed, it would be an anomaly if such a company didn’t have high sales volume on Cyber Monday, especially if Cyber Monday sales volumes for previous years were very high. The absence of change can be an anomaly if it breaks a pattern that is normal for the data from that particular metric. Anomalies aren’t categorically good or bad, they’re just deviations from the expected value for a metric at a given point in time.

### Types of Anomalies
Understanding the types of outliers that an anomaly detection system can identify is essential to getting the most value from generated insights. Without knowing what you’re up against, you risk making the wrong decisions once your anomaly detection system alerts you to an issue or opportunity.
Generally speaking, anomalies in your business data fall into three main outlier categories — global outliers, contextual outliers, and collective outliers.
1. Global outliers
Also known as point anomalies, these outliers exist far outside the entirety of a data set.
2. Contextual outliers
Also called conditional outliers, these anomalies have values that significantly deviate from the other data points that exist in the same context. An anomaly in the context of one dataset may not be an anomaly in another. These outliers are common in time series data because those datasets are records of specific quantities in a given period. The value exists within global expectations but may appear anomalous within certain seasonal data patterns.
3. Collective outliers
When a subset of data points within a set is anomalous to the entire dataset, those values are called collective outliers. In this category, individual values aren’t anomalous globally or contextually. You start to see these types of outliers when examining distinct time series together. Individual behavior may not deviate from the normal range in a specific time series dataset. But when combined with another time series dataset, more significant anomalies become clear.
### Challenges in Anomaly Detection
When it works, anomaly detection showcases the power of machine learning in a manner that feels like magic. However, getting the magic to work as intended can be a remarkably difficult process when you look under the hood. 
Some of the most common challenges that need to be overcome during anomaly detection are:
Data Quality
One of the first questions you may ask while considering an anomaly detection model is “Which algorithm should I choose?” Naturally, your answer will depend upon the nature of the problem you are trying to solve. 
But even more crucial than selecting the right algorithm is the quality of your input data.
Data quality is the single biggest factor that will determine how successful your anomaly detection model can be. Your input data sets may have several problems – incomplete entries, inconsistent formats, duplicates, different benchmarks for measurement, human error – that must be ironed out meticulously to give the ML model the best chance of succeeding.
Size of training data samples
Having a large enough training data set is extremely important for several reasons. If you don’t have enough training data, the algorithm won’t have enough historical context to accurately build a model of what “normal” data looks like. 
One of the easiest ways to understand the problems that may be caused by an insufficient training set is to consider the example of a supermarket. As part of normal operations, customer traffic spikes at certain times of the day, certain days of the week and during certain seasons. Without enough of a historical data set to understand this seasonality, it can be difficult to understand why sales go up or down at different periods.
False alarms
A dynamic anomaly detection system learns from the past to identify expected patterns of behaviour and predicts anomalous events. But what if your model consistently throws up the wrong alerts at the wrong time?
It is crucial to achieve a balance in the sensitivity of your model, because leaning too much in either direction can make you lose the trust of your customers.
One of the things you may want to look at if you are getting a lot of false alerts is how strict your limits are around the baseline. If the limits are too narrow, the model may falsely detect normal variance as an anomaly. Additionally, you should increase the sample size used to inform the algorithm. More historical data will allow the model to account for expected outliers and improve its overall accuracy.
Imbalanced distributions
One of the most common ways to build an anomaly detection model is with a supervised algorithm which requires labelled data to understand what is good and what isn’t. 
However, labelling data usually creates a problem called distribution imbalance. In many domains, the volume of normal samples will swamp the volume of anomalous samples (e.g. credit card fraud) . As a result, the model may not have enough examples to properly learn what is a ‘bad’ state.
Black swan events
Anomaly detection methods work by learning what is “normal” and then flagging data that deviates from that norm. When rare black swan events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, occur, anomaly detection models are thrown off since the behavior of underlying data generation processes change overnight. For instance, flight cancellations in the first few days of lockdowns being announced were through the roof and online food ordering saw jumps of orders of magnitudes. Any anomaly detection systems put in place by companies like Booking.com and Uber would have failed and new models would have to be trained.
## Anomaly Detection Techniques
Explore the various techniques used for Anomaly Detection, including statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches.

### Statistical Methods
Statistical methods for anomaly detection are based on identifying data points that deviate from expected statistical distributions or patterns. These methods are often simple to implement and can be useful when the dataset is small or when the data is expected to follow a specific statistical distribution. Some common statistical methods for anomaly detection include the percentile and interquartile range (IQR) methods.
Percentile method
The percentile method is based on identifying data points that fall outside a specific percentile range. This method considers data points that fall outside the specified percentile range anomalies.
Here’s an example code snippet demonstrating the percentile anomaly detection method using Python.
```python
import numpy as np

# Generate a random dataset
data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)

# Define the percentile range for anomaly detection
percentile_range = (1, 99)

# Identify the values at the specified percentiles
percentiles = np.percentile(data, percentile_range)

# Identify anomalies
anomalies = np.where((data < percentiles[0]) | (data > percentiles[1]))

# Print the indices of the anomalies
print("Anomalies:", anomalies)
```
Interquartile range (IQR) method
The interquartile range (IQR) method is based on the range between the first and third quartiles of the dataset. In this method, data points that fall outside a certain IQR range are considered anomalies.
In Python, this is implemented as the following.
```python
import numpy as np

# Generate a random dataset
data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)

# Calculate the first and third quartiles of the dataset
q1, q3 = np.percentile(data, [25, 75])

# Calculate the interquartile range of the dataset
iqr = q3 - q1

# Define the IQR range for anomaly detection
iqr_range = (q1 - 1.5 * iqr, q3 + 1.5 * iqr)

# Identify anomalies
anomalies = np.where((data < iqr_range[0]) | (data > iqr_range[1]))

# Print the indices of the anomalies
print("Anomalies:", anomalies)
```

### Machine Learning Approaches
Machine learning-based methods for anomaly detection involve using supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms to automatically identify anomalies in data without solely relying on traditional data statistics. These methods typically require a training dataset with both normal and anomalous data points to build a model that can identify anomalies in new data.
Supervised Methods
Supervised machine learning algorithms are trained on a labeled dataset that includes both normal and anomalous data points. The algorithm learns to classify new data points as either normal or anomalous based on the features of the data. The performance of the algorithm can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Support Vector Machines
SVM is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm for anomaly detection. They are effective in separating data points into two classes based on the features of the data. The algorithm learns to draw a boundary between the normal and anomalous data points in the feature space. Data points that fall outside this boundary are classified as anomalies.
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import OneClassSVM

# Generate a random dataset
data = np.random.normal(0, 1, (1000, 2))

# Train an One-Class SVM on the dataset
svm = OneClassSVM(gamma='auto').fit(data)

# Predict the anomaly scores for each data point
scores = svm.score_samples(data)

# Define a threshold for anomaly detection
threshold = np.percentile(scores, 5)

# Identify anomalies
anomalies = np.where(scores < threshold)

# Print the indices of the anomalies
print("Anomalies:", anomalies)
```
Confidence Learning
Confidence learning is a technique in machine learning where a model is trained to predict not only the class or label of a given input but also the confidence or certainty of its prediction. In other words, the model learns to assign a probability or score to each possible class, indicating how confident it is in its prediction.
This is particularly useful in anomaly detection, where identifying rare events or outliers is crucial. By using confidence learning, we can train a model to not only detect anomalies but also to estimate the likelihood or probability that a given input is anomalous.
Here is an example of implementing confidence learning in PyTorch.
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

class AnomalyDetector(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(AnomalyDetector, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(28*28, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, 16),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(16, 8),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(8, 4),
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(4, 8),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(8, 16),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(16, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 28*28),
            nn.Sigmoid(),
        )
        self.criterion = nn.MSELoss()
   
    def forward(self, x):
        z = self.encoder(x)
        x_hat = self.decoder(z)
        return x_hat, z
   
    def training_step(self, batch):
        x, _ = batch
        x_hat, z = self(x)
        loss = self.criterion(x_hat, x)
        return loss
   
    def validation_step(self, batch):
        x, _ = batch
        x_hat, z = self(x)
        loss = self.criterion(x_hat, x)
        return {'val_loss': loss}
   
    def validation_epoch_end(self, outputs):
        avg_loss = torch.stack([x['val_loss'] for x in outputs]).mean()
        return {'val_loss': avg_loss}
   
    def configure_optimizers(self):
        optimizer = optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
        return optimizer

class ConfidenceAnomalyDetector(AnomalyDetector):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ConfidenceAnomalyDetector, self).__init__()
        self.confidence_layer = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(4, 2),
            nn.Softmax(dim=1)
        )
   
    def forward(self, x):
        z = self.encoder(x)
        x_hat = self.decoder(z)
        confidence = self.confidence_layer(z)
        return x_hat, z, confidence

class AnomalyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, X):
        self.X = torch.Tensor(X)
   
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.X)
   
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        x = self.X[idx]
        return x, 0

# train the model with confidence learning
model = ConfidenceAnomalyDetector()
train_dataset = AnomalyDataset(X_train)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=128, shuffle=True)
val_dataset = AnomalyDataset(X_val)
val_dataloader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=128)
trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=100, progress_bar_refresh_rate=10, gpus=1)
trainer.fit(model, train_dataloader, val_dataloader)

# detect anomalies with confidence scores
test_dataset = AnomalyDataset(X_test)
test_dataloader = DataLoader(test
_dataset, batch_size=128)
anomalies = []
for x in test_dataloader:
    score, is_anomaly = model(x.to(device))
    anomalies.extend(x[~is_anomaly.cpu().numpy()])

#plot the anomalies
anomalies = torch.stack(anomalies).cpu().numpy()
plt.plot(X_test, label='normal')
plt.scatter(np.arange(len(anomalies)), anomalies, label='anomaly', color='red')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
Unsupervised Methods
Unsupervised machine learning-based methods for anomaly detection involve training models on a dataset without any labels indicating the presence of anomalies. These models can then detect anomalies in new, unseen data.
One of the advantages of unsupervised machine learning-based methods for anomaly detection is that they can be used to detect previously unseen anomalies that were not present in the training data. However, because they do not use labeled data, it can be challenging to determine the severity or importance of the detected anomalies. One popular unsupervised method for anomaly detection is the isolation forest algorithm, which uses decision trees to isolate anomalies from the rest of the data.
Here’s an example of how to implement the isolation forest algorithm in Python using the scikit-learn library.
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Generate some random data
X = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=(1000, 2))
X[:10] = np.random.normal(5, 0.5, size=(10, 2))

# Create and fit the isolation forest model
clf = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, contamination=0.05, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X)

# Predict the anomalies
y_pred = clf.predict(X)

# Get the indices of the anomalies
anomaly_indices = np.where(y_pred == -1)[0]
```
### Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection
Deep Learning-based methods are also automatic anomaly detectors. Deep Learning itself is a subset of Machine Learning. However, Deep Learning models tend to be more complex, and they are automatic feature extractors and predictors, unlike Machine learning models that use handcrafted features.
Deep learning-based methods have shown great success in detecting anomalies in high-dimensional datasets. These methods rely on neural networks with multiple hidden layers to learn complex patterns in the data and identify anomalies based on deviations from these learned patterns. Autoencoders are famous for this.
Autoencoders are composed of two distinct parts- an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent space representation, and the decoder reconstructs the original input from the latent space representation. When an anomaly is encountered, a trained autoencoder is less able to accurately reconstruct the input data, indicating the presence of an anomaly.
Here is an example of how to implement an autoencoder for anomaly detection on the MNIST dataset.
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

# Define the autoencoder architecture
class Autoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Autoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(28 * 28, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 12),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(12, 2),
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(2, 12),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(12, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 28 * 28),
            nn.Sigmoid(),
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.encoder(x)
        x = self.decoder(x)
        return x

# Define the dataset class
class MNISTDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, targets):
        self.data = data
        self.targets = targets

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        x = self.data[index].flatten().float()
        y = self.targets[index]
        return x, y

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

# Load the MNIST dataset
train_data = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor())
test_data = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor())

train_loader = DataLoader(MNISTDataset(train_data.data, train_data.targets), batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(MNISTDataset(test_data.data, test_data.targets), batch_size=64, shuffle=False)

# Define the autoencoder model and optimizer
autoencoder = Autoencoder()
optimizer = optim.Adam(autoencoder.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the autoencoder
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for data, _ in train_loader:
        data = data.view(data.size(0), -1)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        recon_data = autoencoder(data)
        loss = nn.BCELoss()(recon_data, data)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Detect anomalies in the test set
anomaly_scores = []
for data, _ in test_loader:
    data = data.view(data.size(0), -1)
    recon_data = autoencoder(data)
    loss = nn.BCELoss(reduction='none')(recon_data, data)
    loss = loss.sum(dim=1)
    anomaly_scores += loss.tolist()

# Visualize the anomaly scores
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(anomaly_scores, bins=50)
plt.xlabel('Anomaly Score')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

## Implementing Anomaly Detection

# Generate some example data
np.random.seed(0)
mu, sigma = 0, 0.1  # mean and standard deviation
data = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)

# Function to detect anomalies
def anomaly_detection(data, threshold=3.5):
    mean = np.mean(data)
    std = np.std(data)
    anomalies = []
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if abs(data[i] - mean) > threshold * std:
            anomalies.append(i)
    return anomalies

# Detect anomalies
anomalies = anomaly_detection(data)

# Plot the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(data, label='Data')
